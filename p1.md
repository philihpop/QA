## Objectives and Tasks

### Part 1: Learn the Quantum Algorithm
Understand the quantum algorithm for topological data analysis:
- What problem does the quantum algorithm solve?
- How does the quantum algorithm and its subroutines work?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses?
- What is the computational complexity?

### Part 2: Study Combinatorial Laplacians in Network Analysis

**Task 2.1: Choose a Graph Family**
Pick a family of graphs/complex networks to analyze. Examples:
- Erdős-Rényi graphs
- Zachary karate club (from paper *)
- Graph filtrations (from paper **)

**Task 2.2: Compute Spectral Properties**
Compute spectral properties of combinatorial Laplacians¹ and investigate whether they correlate with network properties.

**Network Properties to Investigate:**
- Average degree
- Centrality
- Width
- Girth
- Diameter
- Any other graph property

**Spectral Properties of Combinatorial Laplacian $\Delta_G^k$**

Given eigenvalues $\{\lambda_j\}$, compute:

(a) **Nullity:** $\dim \ker(\Delta_G^k) = \#\{\lambda_j = 0\}$

(b) **Low-lying spectral density:** $\#\{\lambda_j < b\}$

(c) **Trace:** $\text{Tr}(\Delta_G^k) = \sum_j \lambda_j$

(d) **$\ell$-th spectral moment:** $\sum_j \lambda_j^\ell$

(e) **Quasi-Wiener index:** $\sum_j \frac{\text{rank}(\Delta_G^k)+1}{\lambda_j}$

(f) **Spanning-tree number:** $\log\left(\frac{1}{\text{rank}(\Delta_G^k)+1} \prod_j \lambda_j\right)$

¹Try to perform analysis on multiple combinatorial Laplacians for different clique sizes $k$.

### Part 3: Quantum Speedup Analysis
Explain how and when quantum computers can provide speedup over classical methods for the analysis performed in Part 2.

### Part 4: [Harder] Eigenvector Analysis
Investigate how to sensibly include **eigenvectors** of the combinatorial Laplacian in the analysis and algorithms discussed above.

## Important Notes

- Report should be 5-10 pages (group work - everyone contributes)
- Submit code along with report
- All group members should understand basic ideas: problem, algorithm, cost, applicability
- Work can be split fairly (some focus on implementation, others on theory/writing)
- All group members receive the same grade for Part 2
